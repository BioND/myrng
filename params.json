{"google":"","body":"# MyRNG: A convenient random number generator\r\n\r\nThe MyRNG C++ classes provide two very efficient random number generators\r\nand several methods for generating random variates. You can choose between\r\nthe Mersenne Twister MT19937a algorithm in the implementation of [Makoto\r\nMatsumoto and Takuji Nishimura][1] and the well-equidistributed long-period\r\nlinear generator [WELL1024a][2] implemented by Marton Morvai. Both generators are\r\nessentially shuffled linear congruential random number generators; they should\r\nnot be used for cryptography applications but should otherwise cover most\r\nscientific needs. While the WELL1024a is slightly faster in the current\r\nimplementation, the MT19937a has an astronomical recurrence time of 2^19937.\r\nFurthermore, the methods are provided to generate several random variates\r\nincluding uniform, Gaussian, Beta, and Gamma distributions. Generation of most\r\nrandom variates is based on [Law and Kelton, 2000][3]. Generation of the Gamma\r\ndistribution is based on [Marsagli and Tsang, 2000][4].\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html \"M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura.

To use it as a shared \r\nlibrary include _either_ `myrngMT.h` (MT19937a) _or_ `myrngWELL.h` (WELL1024a)\r\nin your code, and _link the compiled binaries to_ `libmyrngMT` or `libmyrngWELL`,\r\nrespectively. Including the header files creates an instance of the\r\ncorresponding `myrng::RandomVariates` class called `rng`. Random variates can \r\nbe obtained by calling the corresponding member functions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a random variable from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 can\r\nbe obtained as\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include <myrngWELL.h>      // use the WELL1024a generator\r\ndouble u = rng.Uniform01();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a random variable from an exponential distribution with mean `m` as\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include <myrngMT.h>       // let's use the MT19937 generator\r\ndouble m = 0.7;\r\ndouble v = rng.Exponential(m);\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe preferred method to use MyRNG is to create your own instance of the random\r\nnumber generator instead of using a global variable. To that end, do _not_ \r\ninclude the above header files. Instead, use for this purpose\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include <myrng.h>\r\nmyrng::WELL1024a rng_well; // random variates using the WELL1024a generator\r\nmyrng::MT19937 rng_mt;     // random variates using the MT19937 generator\r\ndouble x = rng_well.Exponential(0.3);\r\ndouble y = rng_mt.Exponential(0.7);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you do not have to link the compiled binaries to additional\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the full source code documentation, which you can extract\r\nusing the doxygen source code documentation tool.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS\r\nOR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\r\nAND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
